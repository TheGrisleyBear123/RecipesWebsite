    <p>A veggie burrito is a delicious and satisfying meal packed with fresh, flavorful ingredients. It typically consists of a soft flour tortilla filled with a combination of rice, beans, grilled or saut√©ed vegetables like bell peppers, onions, and zucchini, as well as fresh toppings such as lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, and salsa. Some variations include cheese, sour cream, or a drizzle of spicy sauce for extra flavor. The beauty of a veggie burrito lies in its versatility, as it can be customized to suit different tastes and dietary preferences. Whether enjoyed as a quick lunch or a hearty dinner, this plant-based dish is both nutritious and full of bold, savory flavors.</p>
