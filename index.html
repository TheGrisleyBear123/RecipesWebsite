It typically consists of a soft flour tortilla filled with a combination of rice, beans, grilled or saut√©ed vegetables like bell peppers, onions, and zucchini, as well as fresh toppings such as lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, and salsa. Some variations include cheese, sour cream, or a drizzle of spicy sauce for extra flavor.
